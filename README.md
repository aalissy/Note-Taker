# Note-Taker

## Description
For this assignment I was tasked with creating a note taker that saves and writes notes. I utilized .get, .post, and .delete in order to get saved notes, write new notes, and delete already created notes. I was also tasked with deploying the website on Heroku of which the link is down below.

## User Story
AS A small business owner

I WANT to be able to write and save notes

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Acceptance Criteria

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
